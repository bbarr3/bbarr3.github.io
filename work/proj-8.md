title: "Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication"
---

In the fall of 2014 I took a course in Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication at Rice University. Over the course of the semester we covered sketching, lo-fidelity prototyping, CAD modeling, laser cutting, 3D printing, molding and casting, CNC milling, and plasma cutting.

This is a sample of my coursework.

### Plasma Cutting

This is a plasma cut nameplate that was cut flat and then bent into shape. It has been brushed with emery cloth and sprayed with a clear lacquer to keep it clean of fingerprints.

### Laser Cutting

For my midterm, I researched and laser cut a model of a clock designed by Galileo. It keeps time, although not as well as Galileo's did.

### 3D Printing

When tasked with creating an object that could only be manufactured using a 3D Printer, I chose to design a version of the Magic 8 Ball. Essentially a die with Yes, No, and Maybe printed on it inside of a sphere, the die is much larger than the viewing hole in the top of the sphere. This feat is only possible if the die was actually built inside of the sphere, which it was.

### Molding & Casting
