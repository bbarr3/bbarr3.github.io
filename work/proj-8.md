title: "Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication"
---

Fall, 2014

I took a course on Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication at Rice University known as Engineering 210. Over the course of a semester we covered sketching, lo-fidelity prototyping, CAD modeling, laser cutting, 3D printing, molding and casting, CNC milling, and plasma cutting.

This is a sample of my coursework.

### Plasma Cutting

This is a plasma cut nameplate that was cut flat and then bent into shape. It has been brushed with emery cloth and sprayed with a clear lacquer to keep it clear of fingerprints.

### Laser Cutting

For my midterm, I researched and laser cut a model of a clock designed by Galileo. It keeps time, although not as well as Galileo's did.

### 3D Printing

When tasked with creating an object that could only be manufactured using a 3D Printer, I chose to design a version of the Magic 8 Ball. Essentially a die with Yes, No, and Maybe printed on it inside of a sphere, the die is much larger than the viewing hole in the top of the sphere. This feat is only possible if the die was constructed inside of the sphere, which can only be done with a 3D Printer.

### Molding & Casting & CNC Milling

For the final exam, I chose to combine several techniques together and make a 3D visualization of Houston's registered voter population. I started by creating a map of Houston in ArcGIS that contained voter registration information by zip code. I then used Rhino to extrude the zip codes to various heights proportional to the level of voter registration. I then generated GCODE for the CNC mill using Autodesk's Fusion 360 and used a CNC Mill to cut a mold in a block of wood. From this mold I then cast the finished visualization which I now use as a jar opener.
