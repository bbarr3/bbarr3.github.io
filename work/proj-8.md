title: "Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication"
---

In the fall of 2014 I took a course in Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication at Rice University. Over the course of the semester we covered sketching, lo-fidelity prototyping, CAD modeling, laser cutting, 3D printing, molding and casting, CNC milling, and plasma cutting.

This is a sample of my coursework.

### Plasma Cutting

This is a plasma cut nameplate that was cut flat and then bent into shape. It has been brushed with emery cloth and sprayed with a clear lacquer to keep it clean of fingerprints.
