title: Sprawl Series Coasters
---

In the summer of 2015, Data Design Co_ released its first product: a set of coasters that displays the growth of urban sprawl over time. Each coaster set tracks the history of a major city in the United States from their birth to the present day. The first set traced Chicago and Houston from their near similar founding dates of 1833 and 1836 respectively, while a set detailing Los Angeles was released at a slightly later date.

Individual coasters provide a snapshot in time of the city for a specific year: its outlines, population, and square miles of real estate. All of this data is laser etched onto each plexiglass coaster.

These plexiglass coasters can be used traditionally to hold your drink. Each coaster serves as a physical almanac that you can use as a conversation starter.

These coasters live in a stand that orients them vertically. When held up to the eye the concentric city outlines allow the viewer to look through time and see the expansion of the city. The stand is also laser cut and assembles via snap fitting.

I designed these coasters using Adobe Illustrator to prepare the files and prototyped them at [PostStudio](http://www.poststudioprojects.com/), a local laser cutting studio. We then partnered with PostStudio to manufacture a limited run of 100 coaster sets that have been selling quite well over the last few months.
