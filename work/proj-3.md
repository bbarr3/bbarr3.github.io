Rice Bikes is a full service, student-run bike shop on the campus of Rice University. We maintain a fleet of 38 rental bicycles, employ 15 people for more than 150 hours a week, and are responsible for fixing thousands of bicycles per year. When I was hired as General Manager in the fall of 2013, however, hardly any of this was true. We had six employees that were being paid less than $2/hour, there was no system for recording transactions, and our shop was located in a closet in the basement of a building customers could only enter if they lived there. It was immediately apparent that things needed to change.

In the first year of my term as General Manager I worked with a growing team of student managers to create a system for tracking transactions so that we could determine how much money we were making and from which repairs. We then used this information to set prices that would allow us to pay our employees, pay for rent, and save for long term capital improvements. After these price increases we were still the cheapest bicycle shop in Houston by a 40% margin.

In the fall of 2014 we were able to move to a much more visible location in the Rice Student Center and our revenue grew by more than 10X in the first year. We were able to double the size of our staff, add a rental bicycle program, and run twice monthly community rides.

This year we are on track have our best year to date. Our revenues are quadruple what they were this time last year. I partnered with a team of computer science students to develop a web application to track repairs in the shop as well as manage our transactions with customers, which has helped us scale much more efficiently. In addition we have expanded our community involvement by partnering with a local nonprofit, [Freewheels Houston](http://freewheelshouston.org/), to provide used bicycles for refugees.
