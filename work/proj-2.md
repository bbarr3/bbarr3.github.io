title: The Coaster Campaign
---

In the summer of 2015 I worked with public sector consulting firm, [January Advisors](www.januaryadvisors.com), on a series of design projects for the League of Women Voters aimed at increasing Houston's abysmal 14% voter turnout rate. One of my projects was to design a series of drink coasters printed with facts and statistics about Houston to see if providing political information in nonpolitical spaces would increase someone's likelihood of voting.

There were three steps to this process: designing the coasters, designing the polling system, and field testing.

###The Coasters

I created the coasters by repeatedly laser etching the surface of a rubber block in order to create a stamp. The ink was then rolled on the blocks and pressed against disposable fiberboard coasters.

The coasters were designed using Adobe Illustrator and an extensive period of research and brainstorming. I generated hundreds of ideas, but I ultimately selected three negative and three positive statisics to use for the coasters.

###The Polling System

In order to collect feedback on the effectiveness of these coasters, I designed and built a laser cut ballot box. Patrons of the bar would simply be asked to place their coaster in a slot corresponding to their answer to the question "How has this coaster influenced your likelihood of voting in the local elections in November?" before recieving another drink.

###Testing

We tested this system at scale at Buffalo Bayou Brewery in July, 2015 with promising results. 35% of the respondants reported the coasters as making them more likely to vote with less than 1% reporting the opposite.
