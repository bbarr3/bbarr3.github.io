title: The Coaster Campaign
---

In the summer of 2015 I worked with public sector consulting firm, [January Advisors](www.januaryadvisors.com), on a series of design projects for the Leauge of Women Voters aimed at increasing Houston's abysmal 14% voter turnout rate. One of my projects was to design a series of drink coasters to see if providing political information in nonpolitical spaces would increase someone's likelihood of voting.

There were three steps to this process: designing the coasters, designing the polling system, and field testing.

###The Coasters

I created the coasters by repeatedly laser etching the surface of a rubber block in order to create a stamp. The ink was then rolled on the blocks and pressed against disposable fiberboard coasters.
