title: Wide Awake Dreaming
---

Spring, 2013

I released a solo album on Regeneration Records called Wide Awake Dreaming. Recorded completely at Infinity Studios in Atlanta, GA, Wide Awake Dreaming was the product of a year's worth of writing, recording, and producing. The first release on Regeneration Records, Wide Awake Dreaming sold out of the limited run of 100 CDs produced and even received some air time on the radio.
