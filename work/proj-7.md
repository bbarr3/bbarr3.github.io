I worked as a research assistant at the Georgia Tech Research Institute's Food Processing Technology lab from 2011 through 2013. During my time at GTRI most of my projects were covered by NDAs, but in general terms these were the three major projects I worked on.

During my first summer at GTRI I designed and built a photobioreactor to grow algae for use as a biofuel. I grew the algae in a series of differently oxygenated environments in an effort to determine the optimal oxygen level for oil production. Each reactor's algae concentration was measured spectroscopically and then treated to determine oil content.

My second summer at GTRI was spent doing research and development for an environmental technology startup. A substance that absorbed phosphates abnormally well had been discovered, so I worked on a team to develop a method for using this substance to pull fertilizer runoff out of lakes and recycle it back in to fertilizer. The startup then went on to raise capital and run a pilot program in a Florida lake.

My third year with GTRI I worked with a large beverage company to measure energy usage and loss in their vending machines. We were able to identify several areas for improvement, but more than that I cannot say due to the NDA.
