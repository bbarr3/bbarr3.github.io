title: Fed Up App
---

Fall, 2014 

I worked with a team of teachers and developers in the Houston area to develop a mobile application that would allow students to give feedback on the school lunch experience. Designed and built as part of a 72-hour education-focused Startup Weekend, the application not only allowed students to vote on their favorite meals, but it also provided information on nutrition and collected data on food waste. I built out the UI and UX of the app, as well as the back-end data analytics. The application won the 2014 Houston Startup Weekend and was a finalist for the 4.0 Schools startup accelerator. It was piloted in 3 Houston Independent School District Schools in 2015.
