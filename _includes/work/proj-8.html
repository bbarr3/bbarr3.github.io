<!-- <h2>Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication</h2>

<p>In the Fall of 2014 I took a course in rapid prototyping and fabrication. Over the course of the semester we covered sketching, lo-fidelity prototyping, CAD modeling, laser cutting, 3D printing, molding and casting, CNC Milling, and plasma cutting.</p>

<p>This is a sample of my work.</p>
